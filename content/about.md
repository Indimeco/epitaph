# Why this site

In 1821 in Rome, the poet John Keats lay in his deathbed. He asked his dear friend to inscribe this epitaph upon his tomb:

> Here Lies One Whose Name was writ in Water

There as at once something unaccountably solemn in this epitaph, namely that one's name should fade away in mere moments and be entirely forgotten.
And yet, there is also something unaccountably attractive about the image of words in water, of the ephemeral and the fleeting and the natural.

We often think of software and the internet as permanent, but they are ephemeral. Try to find websites from the 90s or early 2000s. Hosting companies turn the lights off, DNS servers burn out, hard drives fail.
The internet is a garden; without gardeners it dissolves.

Here is a pond for me, a patch of mud, a few water lilies. Here is a place where I write in the water.
