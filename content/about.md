# About

In 1821 in Rome, the poet John Keats lay in his deathbed. He asked his dear friend to inscribe this epitaph upon his tomb:

> Here Lies One Whose Name was writ in Water

There is as at once a forlorn and solemn quality in this epitaph, in being forgotten, and yet there is also something beautiful about writing in water, about the ephemeral and the fleeting and the natural.

We often think of software and the internet as permanent, but they are ephemeral. Try to find websites from the 90s or early 2000s. Hosting companies turn the lights off, DNS servers burn out, hard drives fail.
The internet is water.

Here is a pond, a patch of mud, a few floating lilies.
