# a fistful of poppies

here is a piece of me
like a fistful of poppies
I have pulled it from the sand,
see where the roots held heart tissue?
they are stained still.

it is not a soft thing, not sweet,
it is made of blisters.
I have dragged it far from the mound
in my teeth, you see the grit?

it is not an offering,
you do not need to accept.
it is before you.
for a quarter century winds have chafed
where it bloomed in the dark;
can you tell I am desperate?

it will not do
to stuff it back inside,
a closeted hurt to cradle,
plucked and pressed into cream paper/

mine is the hand that turns,
open to the sky,
and releases petals into sunlight.
