# gray dust

our lives are touched by a grayness
gray dust swirling in a sunbeam
caught in the sudden flare of dawn fire
gray matter linked on invisible pathways
inexplicably connected
gray spaces concussed by a single piano
echo after echo
gray dust dancing over the vanishing horizon
to a faded twilight
