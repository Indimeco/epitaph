in our boyhoods
you bounded a hunting circle around, you'd
tear at the sand, fearless clawing
youth rippling through you in a sheen
I batted you back, merciless,
cruelly
reveling in the fight
you took the blow, withdrawing

I bobbed a noodle over you
laughing
you nipped it from my fingers,
a gentle greed
I hid kibbles for you in every corner
baked you peanut butter treats

when fireworks sounded
you'd stuff your head in my door
wanting to hide with me, pawing
my proudest drawing
was of you

while all the city slept I still shuffled
to you
we cooked dinner at 2am
you sat with me
sometimes I'd rest my head on you
saying nothing,
solace
you never complained of

you had stopped eating your food
regardless of the ketchup or gravy
you'd lick the sauce
we said we'd spoiled you

one summer you lay in the heat swoon
unable to keep the flies from biting
your mouth a wet slump, something pooling
somebody knew you were in a bad way
I watched dispassionately
when they lifted you up

when did I realize
that day you'd be euthanised
I had only begun to repent
my broken and bent
ways, and now you'd pass beyond
the crematorial fire
I never forgave myself
I cried at your ashes on the shelf

what kind of friend was I
who let you go alone to die?
