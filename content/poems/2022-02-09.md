in our boyhoods
you bounded a hunting circle around, you'd
tear at the sand, fearless clawing
youth rippling through you in a sheen
I batted you back, merciless,
cruelly
reveling in the fight
you took the blow, withdrawing

I bobbed a noodle over you
laughing
you nipped it from my fingers,
a gentle greed
I hid kibbles for you in every corner
baked you peanut butter treats

when fireworks sounded
you'd stuff your head in my door
wanting to hide with me, pawing
my proudest drawing
was of you

while all the city slept I still shuffled
to you
we cooked dinner at 2am
you sat with me
sometimes I'd rest my head on you
saying nothing,
solace
you never complained of

you had stopped eating your food
regardless of the ketchup or gravy
you'd lick the sauce
we said we'd spoiled you

one summer you lay in the heat swoon
unable to keep the flies from biting
your mouth a wet slump, something pooling
somebody knew you were in a bad way
I watched dispassionately
when they lifted you up

when did I realize
that day you'd be euthanised
I had only begun to repent
my broken and bent
ways, and now you'd pass beyond
the crematorial fire
I never forgave myself
I cried at your ashes on the shelf

what kind of friend was I
who let you go alone to die?

solace
noodle
drawing, pawing, clawing, withdrawing
boyhood, would, you'd, could, should
euthanised, surprised, chastised, realized,

you nipped the noodle from my hand, bouncing, laughing,
you guessed which hand I held the bacon in,
I hid you kibbles in every corner

I came to you in the dark
when all the city slept I still shuffled
made my dinner, you sat with me,
I came to rest my head on you

one day you lay in the swoon of the heat
unable to keep the flies from biting
saliva pooling, mom's boyfriend realized
something was wrong, they lifted you ???
a tumor in your throat how long fighting
I should have been at your side when you were euthanised

baptiezed in cremetorial flame,
I cried at your ashes on the shelf

I never liked your name, granted from some
obscure television program or so
he said, liar. Yet we would never know
your first name
