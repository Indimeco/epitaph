# four in the morning

four in the morning
in an icognito tab
i find your photograph
a silver smile
the same thin lips curving a sliver
in a face made fuller
by the years i missed
and the only glimmer is in
obituaries
that omit your name

i run through the night
remembering i damned you
a ghost of a fomor you before the drugs
/the ghost is mine now
hanging its memory in my dreams
singing against the wind
when we were twelve
