# The Tucson Valley

in a blown wasteland
mountains scrape a bowl of stars
for the coyote
who is in love with canyons
and has never dreamed of seas

moonflower nectar
sipped by scrawny cactus wren
his song like sobbing
shaken by rare desert gifts
a mercy of wildflowers

the Gila River
dampens its scrubby bedding
only in April
otherwise it runs with boys
whose shouts echo through the wash

eagle bones on mounds
remember how sage was burned
and water at dusk
danced for by the rainmaker
to grow the golden mesa

the desert settles
as mountains swallow the blood
droplets of the sun
each dweller bequeaths potsherds
of memories on the pyre
