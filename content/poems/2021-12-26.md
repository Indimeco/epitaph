# dandelions

perennially blooming numberless,
the common telltimes close at dusk, small weeds
with tap roots that in sunshade yellows dress
each blowglobe in a hundred downy seeds

a field of dandelion flowers fill
paths to the cemetery on the cape;
like an earth-mottled pall the headstones drape
the far and rising face of high old hill.

collapsed, crumbling, the ancient vaults of stone
hold nameless fathers buried by brothers
a concert of yesterday filled with bone
at dawn the telltimes open fully grown
beloved by sons and daughters, wives or mothers,
their feathered seedlings on the breezes blown
