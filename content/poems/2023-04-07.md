it was control, not love, that day,
she text me she was getting high,
with who and why I didn't try only

lost control

sprinted out onto the street
in thirty meters I lost my feet

the road peeled back my flesh
it wanted to know what I was
drank my bitter blood
but threshed me back onto the curb

I limped home in spasms
and laughed
the towel came back filled 
with the grit that tried to graft
turned the water up to high to blast
the pain was electricity that spilled
and laughed that anyone ever dreamed

of control
