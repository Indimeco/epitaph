I sit at the piano
and could not play
knowing nothing /
thinking of you
making music here
on strings unseen;
the day is departed
you are standing
legs crossed, leaning
one hand on the red cloth
sun-faded, covering,
you rest your cup there /
your shape cast stark
in the kitchen light
looking out
to outer dark /
like still life
objects collected
in this room
where the blinds
are always
shut
