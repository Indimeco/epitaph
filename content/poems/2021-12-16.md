# field

field    
grasses gorge on summer sun
the field is the heart of childhood
the heavy swoon ripens the scent of dew
--an ecstasy of the sun

/somewhere in the American Southwest
grasses like these crunched under my feet
I still smell the haze, pollen, thick as fog,
but now it is the shadows that belong to me
tall and swathed in black
and receding from the coming dawn
into a quiet regard 
under the boughs
